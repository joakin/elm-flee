# Untitled elm-gamejam-4 game (Flee)

## TODO

- [ ] Offset animations by some number to avoid all animals running at the same time
- [ ] Add timer countdown before start with some instructions instead of text in level
- [ ] Flesh out game mechanics
- [ ] Make touch input work. Hard with playground. Unsure on how to proceed now.

Later:

- [ ] FX for menu
- [ ] FX for timer
- [ ] FX for gameplay

## Inspiration

- Keep guardian angel between you and the agent
  - (!) This one was the more chaotic and dynamic, it was very interesting.
    Specially with many people, because you were both the prey and some one
    else's attacker/guardian
- Be between the guardian angel and the agent
  - This one had a bunch of activity but people ended up lining up in a line,
    could be interesting
- Make an equilateral triangle between the angel and the agent
  - This one was fairly calm and not-rushed at all

## Other thoughts about gameplay

- Collecting things while being chased / chasing / protecting
  - For points / unlocking the exit
  - For power-ups/downs for your activity
- Timer of sorts, either time, or stamina, hunger, energy, something to make the
  game more dynamic
- Switching roles between prey/attacker/guardian
- Adding more preys/attackers/guardians
