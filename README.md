# Flee

A small game made for the Elm Game Jam 4. You can play it here: https://joakin.itch.io/flee

The code is gamejam quality, please don't judge me.

## Inspiration

- Keep guardian angel between you and the agent
  - (!) This one was the more chaotic and dynamic, it was very interesting.
    Specially with many people, because you were both the prey and some one
    else's attacker/guardian
- Be between the guardian angel and the agent
  - This one had a bunch of activity but people ended up lining up in a line,
    could be interesting
- Make an equilateral triangle between the angel and the agent
  - This one was fairly calm and not-rushed at all

## Other thoughts about gameplay

- Collecting things while being chased / chasing / protecting
  - For points / unlocking the exit
  - For power-ups/downs for your activity
- Timer of sorts, either time, or stamina, hunger, energy, something to make the
  game more dynamic
- Switching roles between prey/attacker/guardian
- Adding more preys/attackers/guardians
